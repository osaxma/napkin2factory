# Backlog

Items dropped, deferred, or out of scope for v0.1, each with a reason. `src/` may reference
an id here in a `TODO(B-xxxx)` comment.

| id | item | reason / origin |
|---|---|---|
| B-0001 | Playwright Chromium unavailable fallback: HTML-parse checks only | Reserved for environments where the browser download fails; on this host Playwright installed and runs, so the fallback is a `pytest.skip` with reason (D30-style, never silent) |
| B-0002 | Vectorize the z-buffer rasterizer per mesh (currently a Python loop per triangle) | Measured at M2: five views of the enclosure base take <1 s; build123d import warm-up (~5 s) dominates. Revisit only if kiln renders exceed ~60 s |
| B-0003 | Python 3.14 support | Not tried; OCP novtk wheels exist for cp314 per REVIEW E but 3.13 is pinned (D2) |

## Non-goals carried from GRAND_PLAN §1.2 (v0.2+)
